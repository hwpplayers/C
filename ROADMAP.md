This project roadmap, in order of chapters.

0. Presentation of the compilation interfaces ([GCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection), [Makefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makefile), for example)
1. The basic syntax principles of [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)), notion of function
2. The notion of object file and compilation - [Linkage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkage_(software)), generation of an executable file
3. Our first program with [Makefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makefile) and [Linker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linker_(computing))
4. The most used [libraries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)) of the [libc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library)
5. Basic [algorithmic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) exercises with [data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) like [arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure), [lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_(abstract_data_type)) and eventually [trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure))
6. [Systems programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_programming)
7. Concept of [cross-compilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_compiler), and the "lack of libc" that is inherent with it
8. Some [Systems programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_programming) with [QEMU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QEMU), like a simple ```hello world``` [kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)) and stuff
9. Introduction to [Linux kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel) system programming.
